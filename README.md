1. *Login*: The user will be able to login as cashier (order manager), warehouse personnel, data analyst or administrator (Access to all features).

2. *Orders Management*: The cashier will be able to record an order on behalf of the customer.  The products are saved in lists each with a unique id.
During the order, the quantity of each product will be selected, the cost of products, VAT and final cost will be calculated, and an order report will be created, which will be stored.
The order manager will be able to process new customers (create new customers, delete, edit items).

	2. *Guest Customer*: A guest customer with no id. (No customer details will be listed, no rewards will be available and no history will be kept)

4. *CustomerLoyaltySystem*: The customer will be given the opportunity to earn points by making orders and redeem them for a discount .

## Warehouse Monitoring

3. *Edit Product List*: You are be able to edit the product list (create new, edit, delete).
4. *Inventory Details*: The inventory order details (company name of the stock purchased, products and quantities supplied, order cost etc.) will be created by the user.
5. *Storage Resupply Order History*:A procurement history will also be maintained.

## Data Analysis
1. *Order Statistics*: Historical data will be used to generate statistics (revenue, products with most demand, show sales per month and year, etc.
2. *Plots*: The analysed data are used to generate various plots (total sales, monthly sales, most popular product sales, etc.).
3. *Predict Sales for a Following Year*: The sales of a given year will be predicted with linear regression.
